# Term-Pattern

Just playing around with some generative ascii art ideas... more of a way to wrap my head around rust than anything else.

## Run Term-Pattern as a wallpaper:

windows: IDFK how you would do that

Linux (idk about compatability lol it works on hyprland):
 - install kitty
 - do `kitty +kitten panel --edge=background ~/termpattrn`

This seems to be pretty lightweight... ~0.8W GPU usage, but i'm happy to be proven wrong here... I can't see how rendering 30fps in the terminal would be a huge problem.    
Regarding compatability... i don't think that will be an issue for my code, but the panel kitten could be problematic. see [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/panel/) for more info on that.
